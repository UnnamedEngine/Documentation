# UnnamedEngine Documentation
This repo contains the official documentation for UnnamedEngine, it is not on my power to say you should not trust outside sources tho. Content ranges from motivation behind the creation of the engine to explanations on how it works internally.

## Contribuiting
I will carefully analyze all the pull requests, so feel free to contribute to the **UnnamedEngine Book**. Together we can make the docs easier to read and better to understand.

### Translation
Since mdBook lets you have multiple languages, I will kindly ask translation PRs to be verified by atleast one native speaker. That single native speaker can be you.
