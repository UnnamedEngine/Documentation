### _Note_

_Hi! I'm Zoty and these are the docs about Unnamed Engine. I would like to ask you a bit of patience since the docs are not exactly usable, and the information here about features may represent the engine in a future state, which means that not everything listed here works as described, or at all._

# Introduction

Unnamed Engine is a game engine created to power two custom games! But that doesn't mean you can't use it to make your own games too. The engine is [open source](https://github.com/UnnamedEngine/UnnamedEngine) and licensed under the [MIT license](https://github.com/UnnamedEngine/UnnamedEngine/blob/main/LICENSE) :D

The current capabilities of the engine are centered around voxels and complex simulations, UNEN is also the environment where I will implement my college thesis about simulations (more about that later)

The focus of the engine is to provide tools for creating games based around complex simulated worlds. Note that this makes some tasks easier, such as creating ~~ticking~~ entities, and other harder tasks (prepare for a lot of work if you want to create a 2d game). Another thing to take in consideration is that everything is implemented taking voxels as the world format, you will have a hard time not using them. But remember that the engine will grow past these limitations someday.
