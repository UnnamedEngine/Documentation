# Reality Simulation

I should start by saying that this is perhaps the most complex thing I've done in my entire life, turns out creating a solid and realistic simulation of the entire universe takes more than a few days...

UnnamedEngine takes a unique approach to how a universe works by simulating it completely! And yes, you can absolutely run it without a super computer, one could argue that you can even run the simulation on a smartphone since there are plans to port the engine to Android and IOS.

## Summary
- [Introduction](./introduction.md)

## Why
There is a small niche part of the community (me included) that would die for this on a game, a entire universe, right before your eyes, completely explorable.

**_If you can see it, you can get there_**

That's the north of the design behind UE, faking but actually not faking. If you look up all the starts should be there, existing on their own, just waiting for you to explore them.

## Disclaimer
As stated before, not everything inside the documentation works perfectly or is implemented, and currently this is the most W.I.P part of the book. Everything here is subject to change in the future, but hopefully we will find a solid design that doesn't need to change.
