# Structure

Unnamed Engine tries to take the same approach as [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/), which means the engine is provided as "modules" that you can or cannot use. At moment there is not a standard for the working of these modules, as well as any sort of implementation, but UE will implement this as a future update. The reason behind it is making it easier to don't include parts of the software irrelevant to you in the final build of your game.
